Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin\\'s Creed video game series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Order of Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and the Knights Templar, who desire peace through order and control. The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and historical figures. In most games, players control a historical Assassin while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin–Templar conflict in the present-day framing story. Considered a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia series, Assassin\\'s Creed took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, based on the historical Hashashin sect of the medieval Iran (Persia).\\nThe first Assassin\\'s Creed game was released in 2007, and the series has featured thirteen main installments in total, the most recent being Assassin\\'s Creed Mirage in 2023. Main games in the Assassin\\'s Creed series are set in an open world and played from the third-person view. Gameplay revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration, including the use of parkour to navigate the environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles also include competitive and cooperative multiplayer game modes.\\nA new story and occasionally new time periods are introduced in each entry, with the gameplay elements also evolving. There are three overarching story arcs in the series. The first five main games follow Desmond Miles, a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, who uses a machine called the Animus to relive his ancestors\\' memories and find powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden in an attempt to prevent a catastrophic event, referencing the 2012 phenomenon. From Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag to Assassin\\'s Creed Syndicate, Assassin initiates and employees of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars) record genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The next three games, Assassin\\'s Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan on her own quest to save humanity from another disaster.\\nThe main games in the Assassin\\'s Creed franchise have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism for the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs, as well as the prioritising of role-playing mechanics in later titles. The series has received multiple awards and nominations, including multiple Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 200 million copies as of September\\xa02022[update], becoming Ubisoft\\'s best-selling franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. While main titles are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games have been released for consoles, mobiles, and handheld platforms. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, and novels have also been published. A live-action film adaptation of the series was released in 2016.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment history\\nWhile the games in the series have had several narrative arcs, Ubisoft views the series as currently having three periods of development and design philosophy. Until 2015\\'s Assassin\\'s Creed Syndicate, the franchise was structured around single-player content, and while centering on open world spaces and incorporating several role-playing elements, were more action-adventure and stealth-oriented. Period two, covering from Assassin\\'s Creed Origins to Assassin\\'s Creed Mirage, brought in more role-playing elements and live-service features to increase player engagement. \\nPeriod three will launch with Assassin\\'s Creed Shadows, using lessons from the second period of development to make engrossing single-player games similar to the original titles but with features to allow players to share achievements and content with others through a new Animus Hub system that will be integrated with all future and some earlier games.[1][2]\\n\\nPeriod one\\nThe first Assassin\\'s Creed game originated out of ideas for a sequel for Ubisoft\\'s video game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, aiming for the seventh generation of video game consoles. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided to take the gameplay from The Sands of Time into an open-world approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the Order of Assassins, based upon the historical Hashashin sect of Ismaili, who were followers of Shia Islam, heavily borrowing from the novel Alamut.[3][4] Ubisoft developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin escorting a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game Prince of Persia: Assassin,[5] or Prince of Persia: Assassins.[6] Ubisoft was apprehensive to a Prince of Persia game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led the marketing division to suggest the name Assassin\\'s Creed, playing off the creed of the Assassins, \"nothing is true; everything is permitted\". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new intellectual property, eliminating the Prince, and basing it around the Assassins and the Knights Templar in the Holy Land during the 12th century. Additionally, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout history, they came onto the idea of genetic memory and created the Animus device and modern storyline elements. This further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting for when the player character is killed, similar to The Sands of Time.[6]\\nAfter Assassin\\'s Creed was released in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal said they looked to \"rework the global structure\" in developing the sequel, Assassin\\'s Creed II. They felt that parkour was underutilized in the first game and designed the world in the sequel to feature freerun highways to make it easier to enter into parkour moves, for example using rooftops to escape pursuits.[7] The change in setting meant that the game would feature a new cast of characters, including a new protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Assassin\\'s Creed II also brought in more use of crowds to hide in plain sight that the developers had seen used in Hitman: Blood Money, adding more to the concept of social stealth as a gameplay option.[7] Finally, Ubisoft Montreal completely reworked the repetitive mission structure from the first game through numerous side activities, collectibles, and secrets. These additions became a central part of the series going forward as well as other Ubisoft games like Watch Dogs, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy\\'s Ghost Recon.[7] Assassin\\'s Creed II was followed by two sequels, Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood and Assassin\\'s Creed: Revelations, which also featured Ezio as the main protagonist and introduced the ability for players to recruit NPCs as Assassins and manage them in missions.[7]\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III originated from both Ubisoft Montreal, who wanted to progress the series\\' narrative forward in time, and to an unattached project that had been developed at Ubisoft Singapore and featured naval ship combat. As the main team had settled into the American Revolution period for the game, they found the ship-to-ship combat system fitted with the story and redesigned the setting to incorporate it further. Another major change in Assassin\\'s Creed III was transitioning the parkour and freerun systems to work in the natural woodlands of 18th-century Massachusetts and New York. This further allowed the adding of trees and other vegetation within the city areas themselves, not just as part of the parkour systems, but to add more varied environments, which would continue as part of the series\\' ongoing design.[7]\\nFor Assassin\\'s Creed III\\'s sequel, Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag, the Ubisoft team built upon the foundation of its predecessor, particularly with regards to the naval gameplay, merging it seamlessly with the land-based gameplay.[7] The team also used the game as a chance to address aspects of the series\\' storyline. Choosing to focus on an outsider\\'s perspective to the Assassin–Templar conflict, they set the game around the Golden Age of Piracy, with the protagonist, Edward Kenway, starting out as a pirate who initially becomes involved in the conflict with the prospect of wealth. Similarly, after the conclusion of Desmond Miles\\' story arc in Assassin\\'s Creed III, the modern-day segments put players in the role of a nameless individual controlled from a first-person perspective. The team chose this approach because they believed it allowed players to more easily identify themselves in their character.[7] This trend would continue in the series until Assassin\\'s Creed Syndicate.[7]\\nDevelopment of Assassin\\'s Creed Unity began shortly after the completion of Brotherhood in 2010,[8] with the core development team splitting off during the early stages of development on Assassin\\'s Creed III.[9] As the first game in the series to be released exclusively for the eighth generation of video game consoles, Unity featured a graphical and gameplay overhaul. The setting chosen for the game was Paris during the early years of the French Revolution, with players taking control of a new Assassin named Arno Dorian.[8][9] After Unity, Ubisoft released Assassin\\'s Creed Syndicate in 2015.[7]\\n\\nPeriod two\\nFollowing Syndicate\\'s release, Ubisoft decided that the series needed a major reinvention across both gameplay and narrative. It was decided to make the next game, Assassin\\'s Creed Origins, closer to a role-playing video game than a stealth-action game, which would also bring a game with many more hours of play than previous titles. Some long-standing features of the series were eliminated for this purpose, such as the social stealth mechanic. This changed how missions were presented — rather than being linearly directed through the Animus, the player character could meet various quest givers in the game\\'s world to receive missions.[7] From the narrative side, Ubisoft placed the game before the formation of the Assassin Brotherhood in Ancient Egypt to make the player character, Bayek of Siwa, a medjay that people would respect and seek the help of.[7] The modern-day storyline also shifted back to a single character, Layla Hassan. The developers limited the number of playable sequences for her character compared to previous games but gave them more meaning, such as allowing the player to explore Layla\\'s laptop with background information on the game\\'s universe.[7]\\nOrigins was followed in 2018 by Assassin\\'s Creed Odyssey, which shifted the setting to Classical Greece and followed a similar approach to its predecessor but with more emphasis on the role-playing elements.[7] 2020\\'s Assassin\\'s Creed Valhalla, set in Medieval England and Norway during the Viking Age, continued the same style as Origins and Odyssey. The developers recognized feedback from the previous two games and brought back the social stealth elements, as well as the concept of a customizable home base that was first introduced in Assassin\\'s Creed II.[7]\\nIn 2023, Ubisoft released Assassin\\'s Creed Mirage, a smaller title which sought to pay tribute to the franchise\\'s earlier installments by focusing on stealth and assassinations over its predecessors\\' role-playing elements. The game started development as an expansion for Valhalla before being turned into a standalone release, and was set in 9th-century Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age, a decade before the events of Valhalla, to which it served as a prequel.[10][11]\\n\\nPeriod three\\nIn 2022, Ubisoft announced several additional games for the series, including Assassin\\'s Creed Shadows, set in Japan during the Sengoku period,[10][12] and Assassin\\'s Creed: Codename Hexe, rumoured to be set in Central Europe during the 16th century.[13]\\nAlongside the release of Assassin\\'s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft will include the Animus Hub, which will serve as a centralized hub for the Assassin\\'s Creed games from Shadows onward. Originally teased as Assassin\\'s Creed Infinity, the Animus Hub was described by its executive producer, Marc-Alexis Côté, as a \"new design philosophy\" for the series,[1][14] as well as a hub that would provide the releases of future games.[15] According to Coté in 2024, the modern-day narrative of the series had become haphazard after the death of Desmond Miles in Assassin\\'s Creed III through the introduction of Layla Hassan in Assassin\\'s Creed Origins due to the lack of a main character and the number of studios involved, and Infinity aimed to re-establish the modern-day side of the series.[16] The Animus Hub is not a launcher, but instead a feature to be integrated into Shadows, future games, and select games from period two, which will incorporate the modern-day storyline of the series.[2]\\n\\nGameplay\\nAn Assassin\\'s Creed III demo showing the parkour gameplay\\nThe Assassin\\'s Creed games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins. Their memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a diegetic interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as desynchronization of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. Through the Animus interface, the player can retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner, such as by only killing the mission\\'s target. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest.[17][18]\\nWhile playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a third-person view in an open world environment, focusing on stealth and parkour. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a leap of faith into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of the modern-day character who, by nature of the Animus use, has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe, and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors.[19][20]\\nThe games use the concept of active versus passive moves, with active moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards\\' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin\\'s arm, which can be used to perform surreptitious assassinations.[21]\\n\\nStoryline\\nThe logo of the fictional Abstergo Industries, whose slogan is \"We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways.\"\\nPremise\\nThe Assassin\\'s Creed games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies: the Order of Assassins, who represent freedom, and the Knights Templar, who represent order. Versions of these societies have existed for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of the Pieces of Eden, artifacts that can override free will to control people\\'s minds.[22]\\nThese artifacts are remnants of an ancient species pre-dating humanity called the Isu, or Precursors, which created humanity to live in peace alongside them. The Isu ensured humans could not rise against them by creating the Pieces of Eden to control them. When the first hybrid Isu-human beings emerged, named Adam and Eve, they were immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden. They stole the Pieces of Eden, which led to a great war that ended when a massive solar flare devastated the surface of the Earth. The surviving Isu subsequently died out while humanity thrived. All that remained of the Isu were traces of their memories in the world\\'s mythologies and religions, while the Pieces of Eden became lost to time, many of them hidden within underground vaults known as Temples.[22]\\nBefore their demise, three Isu—Minerva, Juno, and Jupiter—attempted to prepare humanity for another solar flare they knew would come millennia later. Using a device called the Eye, which allowed them to see into possible futures, Minerva and Jupiter left behind messages to guide humanity to the Grand Temple, which housed the global aurora borealis device that could activate a protective shield around the Earth. However, Juno saw humanity as a threat and attempted to sabotage Minerva and Jupiter\\'s plan. Minerva and Jupiter were forced to destroy Juno and trapped her consciousness within the Grand Temple, unaware that Juno had modified the global aurora borealis device to release her consciousness upon activation.[22]\\nThe series itself takes place in the modern era, in which the Templars have established the mega-corporation Abstergo Industries. Abstergo has developed a device, the Animus, whose users can relive the memories of their ancestors through their genetic material. Abstergo has kidnapped people who are descendants of past Assassins to locate the missing Pieces of Eden via the Animus.[22] A user of the Animus can move about in simulated memories as their ancestor, but performing actions outside the bounds of what their ancestor did can lead to desynchronization of the memory.[17][18] Extended use of the Animus creates a \"bleeding effect\" that gives users some of the skills and capabilities they experienced with their ancestor, but also affects their mental well-being, as the user begins to confuse their ancestor\\'s memories with their own.[23]\\n\\nStory arcs\\n\\nNarrative chronology of the Assassin\\'s Creed games[22]\\n\\n\\nGame\\n\\nHistorical characterPeriod/era\\n\\nPresent-day character\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed\\n\\nAltaïr Ibn-LaʼAhadThird Crusade\\n\\nDesmond Miles\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II\\n\\nEzio Auditore da FirenzeItalian Renaissance\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Revelations\\n\\nEzio Auditore da FirenzeOttoman Civil WarAltaïr Ibn-LaʼAhadThird Crusade & Mongol invasion of the Levant\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III\\n\\nHaytham KenwayFrench and Indian WarRatonhnhaké:ton / ConnorAmerican Revolution\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag\\n\\nEdward KenwayGolden Age of Piracy\\n\\n\"Noob\" / Abstergo researcher\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rogue\\n\\nShay Patrick CormacFrench and Indian War\\n\\n\"Numbskull\" / Helix researcher\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Unity\\n\\nArno DorianFrench Revolution\\n\\n\"The Initiate\" / Helix player\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Syndicate\\n\\nJacob and Evie FryeVictorian EnglandLydia FryeWorld War I\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Origins\\n\\nBayek and AyaPtolemaic Egypt\\n\\nLayla Hassan\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Odyssey\\n\\nAlexios / KassandraPeloponnesian War\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Valhalla\\n\\nEivor VarinsdottirViking invasion of EnglandOdin / HaviIsu Era\\n\\nLayla HassanBasim Ibn Ishaq\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Mirage\\n\\nBasim Ibn IshaqIslamic Golden Age\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Shadows\\n\\nFujibayashi Naoe and YasukeSengoku period\\n\\n—\\n\\nThe first five main games in the series focus on Desmond Miles, a bartender and former Assassin who learns he is a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, including Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad from the Middle East during the Third Crusade; Ezio Auditore da Firenze from the Italian Renaissance; and Ratonhnhaké:ton (commonly known as Connor), a half-Mohawk, half-British Assassin during the American Revolution. Desmond is used by Abstergo to find Pieces of Eden but is rescued by Lucy Stillman, an undercover agent for the Assassins. With the help of two other Assassins, Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, and later William Miles, Desmond\\'s father and the leader of the modern-day Assassins, the group continue to explore Desmond\\'s memories in the hopes of locating the Pieces of Eden before Abstergo. In the process, they learn about the Isu and come into contact with Juno, who kills Lucy, revealed to be a double agent for the Templars. The group ultimately finds the Grand Temple, and Desmond activates the global aurora borealis device in time to block the solar flare, at the cost of his own life.[22]\\nStarting with Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag, Abstergo has refined the Animus technology to allow anyone to experience memories from the genetic material of another person, allowing the Templars to continue their search for Pieces of Eden under the guise of creating entertainment products. In Black Flag, players assume the role of an unnamed Abstergo employee tasked with researching the memories of Edward Kenway, a pirate-turned-Assassin and Connor\\'s grandfather. During their work, the player is blackmailed by a fellow employee, John Standish, into acquiring and delivering sensitive information on Abstergo\\'s activities to the Assassins. John is later revealed to be a Sage, a human reincarnation of Juno\\'s husband Aita, who is trying to resurrect her, though he is killed by Abstergo before he can succeed.[22]\\nBy the time of Assassin\\'s Creed Unity, Abstergo has begun distributing the Animus technology via a video game console called the Helix, tapping into an extensive, unaware player base to help them locate the remains of various Sages as part of the Phoenix Project, an attempt to recreate the genetic structure of the Isu. The player character is recruited into the Assassins and tasked with exploring the memories of Arno Dorian, an Assassin during the French Revolution, so that the modern-day Assassins can retrieve the body of a Sage and hide it from Abstergo.[22] Despite the Assassins\\' efforts, by the start of Assassin\\'s Creed Syndicate, Abstergo has collected enough DNA samples from other Sages to move forward with the Phoenix Project. The player character is again contacted by the Assassins and relives the memories of Jacob and Evie Frye, twin Assassins from Victorian England, to find a Piece of Eden that Abstergo requires for the next phase of the Phoenix Project. Although the Assassins beat the Templars to it, the latter manage to steal the Piece of Eden and escape with it, whereupon it is revealed that Juno is manipulating various Abstergo employees to further her plans of being resurrected.[22]\\nA new storyline is introduced in Assassin\\'s Creed Origins focusing on Abstergo researcher Layla Hassan. While on an assignment to recover an artifact from Egypt, Layla stumbles upon the remains of the Medjay Bayek and his wife Aya, co-founders of the Hidden Ones, the Assassins\\' precursors. Against Abstergo\\'s orders, Layla uses her personal Animus to relive Bayek\\'s and Aya\\'s memories, causing the Templars to mark her for death. She is rescued by William Miles, who then invites her to join the Assassins for her own protection.[22] In Assassin\\'s Creed Odyssey, Layla recovers the Spear of Leonidas, from which she extracts the DNA of Leonidas\\' grandchildren, Alexios and Kassandra. Through their memories, Layla locates the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus, another Piece of Eden, which is guarded by one of the siblings (canonically Kassandra), still alive due to being sustained by the Staff. Kassandra relinquishes the Staff to Layla, who is prophesied to one day restore balance to the world, and passes away.[22]\\nIn Assassin\\'s Creed Valhalla, Earth is facing yet another disaster, as its magnetic field has been continually strengthening since Desmond\\'s activation of the global aurora borealis device eight years prior. Layla exhumes the remains of Eivor Varinsdottir, a 9th-century Viking, and from her memories, she learns of an Isu temple in Norway. Layla travels to the temple and enters the Grey, a virtual world created by the Isu, where she meets both the Reader (implied to be Desmond\\'s preserved consciousness) and Basim Ibn Ishaq, a Hidden One and the reincarnation of the Isu Loki, who was trapped in the Grey by Eivor. Basim helps Layla stop the disaster but then abandons her in the Grey and escapes back to the real world, where he joins the modern-day Assassins.[24] In Assassin\\'s Creed Mirage, the Assassins use a sample of Basim\\'s DNA to relive his memories of his time as a Hidden One during the Islamic Golden Age, in order to learn more about his nature as a reborn Isu.\\n\\nRelease history\\nThe following table lists the main and spin-off games of the franchise, along with their release years and the respective platform(s) they released on:\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nReleased\\n\\nPlatform\\n\\n\\nMain series\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed\\n\\n2007\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II\\n\\n2009\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, OS X, Nintendo Switch\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood\\n\\n2010\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, OS X, Nintendo Switch\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Revelations\\n\\n2011\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III\\n\\n2012\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag\\n\\n2013\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rogue\\n\\n2014\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Unity\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Syndicate\\n\\n2015\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Origins\\n\\n2017\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Odyssey\\n\\n2018\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Valhalla\\n\\n2020\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Amazon Luna\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Mirage\\n\\n2023\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Luna, iOS\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Shadows\\n\\n2025\\n\\nWindows, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Luna, macOS\\n\\n\\nSpin-offs\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Altaïr\\'s Chronicles\\n\\n2008\\n\\nAndroid, Symbian, iOS, webOS, Windows Phone, Nintendo DS\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Bloodlines\\n\\n2009\\n\\nPlayStation Portable\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II: Discovery\\n\\niOS, Nintendo DS\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Project Legacy\\n\\n2010\\n\\nBrowser\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Multiplayer Rearmed\\n\\n2011\\n\\niPad, iPhone, iPod Touch\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Recollection\\n\\niPad, iPhone, iPod Touch\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III: Liberationa\\n\\n2012\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo Switch, Stadia\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Pirates\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAndroid, iOS\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Freedom Cryb\\n\\n2014\\n\\nWindows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Memories\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Chronicles: Chinac\\n\\n2015\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vitad\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Chronicles: India\\n\\n2016\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vitad\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Chronicles: Russia\\n\\nWindows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vitad\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Identity\\n\\nAndroid, iOS\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Unity: Arno\\'s Chronicles\\n\\n2017\\n\\nAndroide\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rebellion\\n\\n2018\\n\\nAndroid, iOS\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Nexus VR\\n\\n2023\\n\\nMeta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro[25]\\n\\n^a Released under the title Assassin\\'s Creed: Liberation HD for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2014.\\n^b Originally released as DLC for all versions of Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag in 2013.\\n^c Originally announced as part of the season pass for Assassin\\'s Creed Unity.\\n^d Released as a compilation titled Assassin\\'s Creed Chronicles Trilogy Pack.\\n^e Released exclusively for the Honor 9 smartphone.[26]\\n\\n\\nMain series\\nAssassin\\'s Creed\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed (video game)\\nAssassin\\'s Creed logo\\nThe first game in the series was released in November 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in April 2008 for Microsoft Windows. It features a historical recreation of the Holy Land (primarily the cities of Masyaf, Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus) in the late 12th century. Its narrative includes real historical figures and events from that time period. The storyline consists of two portions: one set during the modern-day, which follows Desmond Miles; and one set in 1191, which follows Desmond\\'s ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad, a member of the Assassin Order during the time of the Third Crusade. Desmond\\'s story begins with his abduction by pharmaceutical company Abstergo Industries, whose lead scientist, Dr. Warren Vidic, forces him to explore Altaïr\\'s memories through a machine called the Animus that allows him to connect with his ancestors\\' DNA. In doing so, Abstergo hopes to find powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden, which the Assassins and their rivals, the Knights Templar, have fought over for centuries. Altaïr\\'s story begins with his demotion to the rank of Novice Assassin after he botches an attempt by the Assassins to recover a Piece of Eden, the Apple of Eden, from the Templars. To redeem himself, Altaïr is tasked with assassinating nine Templar targets across the Holy Land.\\nAssassin\\'s Creed introduced core elements that remained in the rest of the series. Players can freely explore the game\\'s open world, making use of Altaïr\\'s parkour and climbing skills to navigate the environment. The game also features refined hack-and-slash combat, with players able to block and counter-attacks, and stealth mechanics, such as hiding in crowds of people, which allow players to avoid detection by enemies or lose pursuing foes. Although players can choose the order in which they kill their main targets, the mission design was seen as linear and repetitive because players had to complete several side quests before each assassination. The side quest prerequisite was one of the most criticized aspects of the game, so it was abandoned in future games.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed II\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II is a direct sequel to the first game and was released in November 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2010 for Windows, and in October 2010 for OS X. The modern-day narrative again follows Desmond, who escapes from Abstergo (revealed at the end of the previous game as a front for the modern-day Templars) with the aid of Assassin mole Lucy Stillman and is taken to her team\\'s hideout. Hoping to train Desmond as an Assassin, they put him in the Animus 2.0, where he begins to suffer from the bleeding effect; this allows Desmond to gain his ancestors\\' skills, but it also damages his mind, as he begins to involuntarily experience flashes of his ancestors\\' memories outside of the Animus. Meanwhile, the main narrative takes place at the height of the Italian Renaissance in the late 15th century and follows Desmond\\'s Italian ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from Florence who is forced to become an Assassin after his father and brothers are killed by the Templars. During his journey to avenge their deaths, Ezio makes allies such as Leonardo da Vinci and Caterina Sforza and combats enemies such as the Pazzi and Barbarigo families and Rodrigo Borgia. Ezio also comes into contact with technology left behind by the First Civilization, a race that created humanity and the Pieces of Eden and who were wiped out by a catastrophic event.\\nSimilar to the first game, Assassin\\'s Creed II incorporates historical events into its narrative and features recreations of several cities from the time period it is set in (in this case, Florence, Venice, Forlì, San Gimignano, and Monteriggioni). Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio\\'s life, and side missions that can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, which acts as the Assassins\\' headquarters for most of the game, provides several functions that can be expanded on by paying for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood is the sequel to Assassin\\'s Creed II, and was released in November 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2011 for Windows, and in May 2011 for OS X. The game begins immediately after the events of its predecessor, at the end of which Desmond was warned by Minerva, a member of the First Civilization, about a solar flare that will hit the Earth and kill most of humanity in a few months. Desmond and his team travel to Monteriggioni, where they set up a new base and use the Animus to find the Temple of Juno, another First Civilization member, which houses Ezio\\'s own Apple of Eden and the key to stopping the solar flare. The main narrative continues the story of Ezio, who travels to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, to re-establish the Assassin Brotherhood there and defeat the Borgias, who have attacked Monteriggioni and stolen the Apple of Eden.\\nBrotherhood shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in one city: Rome. Like the Villa Auditore, the player can spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city to increase the revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so. The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can recruit these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer, in which players assume the role of Abstergo employees who, through the use of the Animus, relive the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.[27] It was the last game to feature Assassin\\'s Creed creator Patrice Désilets, as the creative director of the series.[28][29]\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Revelations\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed Revelations\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Revelations logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Revelations is the final installment of the Ezio Trilogy and was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows. Following the events of Brotherhood, where he was possessed by Juno and forced to kill Lucy (who, unbeknownst to him, was a Templar double agent), Desmond has fallen into a coma and was put back into the Animus to save his mind. Within the computerized core of the Animus, Desmond meets the preserved consciousness of Abstergo\\'s previous Animus test subject, Clay Kaczmarek, who explains that Demond\\'s mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or else he will fall into dementia. Desmond continues exploring the memories of Ezio, who, a few years after the events of Brotherhood, travels to Constantinople to find five keys needed to open a library built by Altaïr, which is said to contain the power to end the Assassin–Templar conflict. In Constantinople, Ezio becomes caught in a war of succession between Sultan Bayezid II\\'s sons, Selim and Ahmet, and must confront a conspiracy masterminded by the Byzantine Templars, who are taking advantage of the chaos to try and reclaim the city, as well as open Altaïr\\'s library themselves.\\nOriginally Revelations was announced as Assassin\\'s Creed: Lost Legacy, and conceptualized as a Nintendo 3DS title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf to explore Altaïr\\'s legacy and uncover the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood.[30][31] Lost Legacy was later announced as cancelled on July 15, 2011, after Ubisoft decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original premise remained and evolved into the plot seen in the final game.[32] Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting and an expanded Assassin recruitment system. The multiplayer mode returns in Revelations, with more characters, modes, and maps; players once again assume the role of Templars in training and as they level up and rise in the ranks, they are told more about Abstergo\\'s history.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed III\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III was released in October 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and in November 2012 for Wii U and Windows. A remastered version of the game with enhanced visuals was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2019 and for Nintendo Switch in May 2019. This is the final game in the series to follow Desmond, who travels to the First Civilization\\'s Grand Temple in New York with his friends and father to use the technology inside to prevent the solar flare set to hit the Earth in several weeks\\' time. To access this technology, Desmond must undertake missions across the globe to retrieve \\'batteries\\' to power the Temple, as well as an ancient key to the Temple\\'s inner chambers. To find the latter, Desmond uses the Animus to relive the memories of two of his ancestors who were in possession of the key at various points in time: Haytham Kenway, a British Templar from the 18th century who travels to the American colonies to establish a strong Templar presence on the continent and find the Grand Temple; and Ratonhnhaké:ton (later known as Connor), Haytham\\'s half-Mohawk son, who becomes an Assassin to exact revenge on the Templars, whom he blames for the destruction of his village and the death of his mother in his youth. To this end, Connor later becomes involved in the American Revolution, helping the Patriot cause in exchange for their help in hunting down Haytham\\'s faction of Templars, who hope to use the Revolution to further their own goals.\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place in an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York. The game offers a large wilderness area in the form of the Frontier and the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles also debut in the series, wherein the player must steer a warship named the Aquila in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. The multiplayer mode from the previous two games returns in Assassin\\'s Creed III with new game modes, characters, and maps inspired by Colonial America, but this time no major narrative elements are included.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag was released in October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U and in November 2013 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Following the events of Assassin\\'s Creed III, at the end of which Desmond sacrificed himself to save the Earth, Abstergo retrieved samples from his body to continue exploring the memories of his ancestors. The player character is an unnamed Abstergo employee tasked with analyzing the memories of Edward Kenway, an 18th-century pirate and Connor\\'s grandfather, ostensibly to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive feature film; in reality, Abstergo are searching for the Observatory, a First Civilization structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject to find them anywhere on the planet. As Edward, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British and Spanish empires into locating the Sage—later identified as Bartholomew Roberts—who is the only man that can lead them to the Observatory.\\nBlack Flag retains many gameplay mechanics from Assassin\\'s Creed III, including the ship-based exploration and combat. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of the game; players can captain Edward\\'s ship, the Jackdaw, and battle rival ships or hunt sea animals. The game includes a large open world spanning the West Indies, with players able to explore the cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, as well as numerous islands, forts, and sunken ships. A multiplayer mode is once again included, although it is entirely land-based.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rogue\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed Rogue\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rogue logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rogue is the final game in the series to be developed for the seventh generation of consoles, being released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2014,[33] and for Windows in March 2015.[34] A remastered version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2018. In the present day, players again take on the role of an unnamed Abstergo employee, tasked with researching the memories of Shay Patrick Cormac, an 18th-century Assassin who, for reasons unknown to Abstergo, defected to the Templars. During their investigation, the player accidentally trips a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers. They must complete Shay\\'s memories to clean the servers while Abstergo is put under lockdown. The main narrative takes place during the Seven Years\\' War,[33] and follows Shay, who starts out as a talented, but insubordinate Assassin trainee. After witnessing the Assassins\\' hypocrisy and willingness to sacrifice civilians in their blind pursuit of the Pieces of Eden, Shay betrays them and joins the Templars, helping his newfound allies hunt down members of his former Brotherhood to prevent them from endangering more innocent lives. Shay\\'s story is set between the events of Assassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin\\'s Creed III, and is meant to fill the gaps between their respective narratives, while also having \"a crucial link to the Kenway saga\" according to Ubisoft, as well as to Assassin\\'s Creed Unity.[35] Several major characters from Assassin\\'s Creed III and Black Flag make appearances in the game, such as Haytham Kenway, Achilles Davenport, and Adéwalé.[36]\\nIn March 2014, a new Assassin\\'s Creed game code-named Comet was revealed to be in development for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, set to release later that year alongside Unity.[37] By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that Comet would be set around 1758 New York City, and would feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. The game would be a direct sequel to Black Flag, and would be the first to feature a Templar as the main protagonist. In May 2014, Guillemot stated that, \"for the foreseeable future\", Assassin\\'s Creed games would continue releasing on the last generation PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, despite the franchise moving to the current generation PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with Unity.[38] On August 5, Ubisoft officially announced the game as Assassin\\'s Creed Rogue. While the game reuses many assets from Black Flag, a number of new systems and weapons were included, such as an air rifle and refined naval combat, and the multiplayer aspect has been removed.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Unity\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed Unity\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Unity logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Unity was released concurrently with Rogue in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows,[39] and in December 2020 for Google Stadia. In the present-day, the player character is a player of Helix, an Animus-powered gaming device produced by Abstergo, who hope to use their unaware player base to locate more Pieces of Eden. While playing, the player is contacted by the modern-day Assassins and invited to join them as an Initiate and help them locate the body of an 18th-century Sage. The main story is set in Paris during the French Revolution, and follows Assassin Arno Dorian as he embarks on a quest for redemption after his foster father\\'s death, which leads him to discover an internal conflict between the Templars as a result of the Revolution.[40]\\nOn March 19, 2014, images leaked for the next Assassin\\'s Creed game, titled or code-named Unity, showing a new assassin in Paris.[37] On March 21, Ubisoft confirmed the game\\'s existence, having been in development for more than three years, by releasing pre-alpha game footage.[41] The game features enhanced visuals compared to its predecessors, and several new gameplay mechanics, including a four player co-op mode, a first for the series.[42]\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Syndicate\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed Syndicate\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Syndicate logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Syndicate was released in October 2015 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in November 2015 for Windows,[43] and in December 2020 for the Stadia. In the present-day, players control the same unnamed Assassin Initiate from Assassin\\'s Creed Unity, who this time must help the Assassins find a powerful artifact, the Shroud of Eden, hidden in London. The main story is set in Victorian era London and follows twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye, as they navigate the corridors of organized crime to take back the city from Templar control and prevent them from finding the Shroud. The narrative also includes segments set in war-torn London during World War I, which follow Jacob\\'s granddaughter, Lydia Frye, as she battles German soldiers and Templar spies and searches for a Sage.\\nIn December 2014, images and information leaked for a new Assassin\\'s Creed game, titled or code-named Victory, which was later confirmed by Ubisoft.[44] In May 2015, Kotaku leaked that Victory had been renamed Syndicate.[45] On May 12, 2015, the game was officially announced by Ubisoft.[46] The game retains most gameplay elements from Unity, while introducing new travelling systems, such as carriages and a grappling hook, and refined combat mechanics. It is the first game in the series to feature multiple playable protagonists, whom the player can switch between both during and outside missions.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Origins\\nMain article: Assassin\\'s Creed Origins\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Origins logo\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Origins is a soft reboot of the franchise, and was released in October 2017 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows,[47] and in December 2020 for the Stadia. The game introduces a new protagonist in the modern-day, Layla Hassan, and explores the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood and their conflict with the Templar Order. The story is set in Ancient Egypt, near the end of the Ptolemaic period, and follows a Medjay named Bayek and his wife Aya, whose fight to protect their people from the Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—leads them to create the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Assassin Brotherhood. Unlike previous installments in the series, which were structured like action-adventure games, Origins is an action role-playing game and introduces many new features to the series, including an overhauled hitbox-based combat system.\\nIn February 2016, Ubisoft announced they would not be releasing a new game in 2016 in order to step \"back and [re-examine] the Assassin\\'s Creed franchise ...

This led to a collaboration to develop the \"most ambitious game\" in the series yet: Assassin\\'s Creed Infinity.[141] Infinity was initially envisioned to be similar to Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto Online, in that it would be more of a service, rather than a game, intended to be an entry point for future Assassin\\'s Creed titles for players as well as to simplify the development of these games across Ubisoft\\'s studios.[142][141][143]\\nMarc-Alexis Côté, from Ubisoft Quebec, was announced to serve as Infinity\\'s executive producer.[144] According to Côté, Infinity would be used to present the modern-day setting of the Assassin\\'s Creed games involving the Animus, while each game would be focused on the historical setting.[145] Clint Hocking and Jonathan Dumont serve as the creative directors, leading the Montreal and Quebec divisions, respectively.[144] Étienne Allonier and Julien Laferrière, both from Montreal, serve as brand director and senior producer, respectively.[144] In September 2022, more details about Assassin\\'s Creed Infinity were revealed, including the fact that the first two games to be included in Infinity would be the then-upcoming Assassin\\'s Creed: Codename Red (later renamed to Assassin\\'s Creed Shadows)[10] and Assassin\\'s Creed: Codename Hexe.[13] In January 2025, Ubisoft officially announced Infinity\\'s rebranding to the Animus Hub and that it would no longer be a standalone title, but rather a feature present in all upcoming Assassin\\'s Creed games.[2]\\n\\nOther media\\nTelevision\\nIn November 2016, it was announced that Ubisoft and Netflix started talks regarding how to develop an Assassin\\'s Creed series.[146] In July 2017, Adi Shankar revealed he would be creating the series, which would be in the anime format.[147] The series, which will feature an original story from Shankar, will share the same universe as the other media of the franchise.[148]\\nA live-action series, an animated series, and an anime series were announced in October 2020 for Netflix. The live-action series would be produced by Ubisoft Film & Television for the streaming service, with Jason Altman and Danielle Kreinik as executive producers and Jeb Stuart as the writer.[149][150] In January 2023, Collider reported that Stuart was no longer involved with the series.[151]\\nElements from Assassin\\'s Creed appear as part of the 2023 animated series Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix.

Following the mysterious assassination of Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, in 1476, Giovanni sets out to find those responsible, leading him to uncover a larger conspiracy masterminded by the Templars and their Grand Master, Rodrigo Borgia.[171]\\n\\nAnimated short films\\nOriginally named Secret Project Number Three,[172] Assassin\\'s Creed: Ascendance is an animated short by UbiWorkshop and Ubisoft Montreal, which bridges the gap between Assassin\\'s Creed II and Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood.[173] It revolves around Cesare Borgia\\'s backstory and rise to power in Italy.\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Embers is a 21-minute animated film included in the Signature and Collector\\'s Editions of Assassin\\'s Creed Revelations; it was later re-released on the PlayStation Store in April 2015. The film serves as an epilogue to Ezio\\'s story, depicting the final days of his life after he retired from the Assassin Brotherhood and started a family. When a mysterious Chinese Assassin named Shao Jun arrives to seek his help and guidance, Ezio must fight to protect his loved ones one last time.\\n\\nPrint publications\\nMain articles: Assassin\\'s Creed (book series) and Assassin\\'s Creed publications\\nThe Assassin\\'s Creed series has a collection of print publications by various authors, including Christie Golden, Oliver Bowden, Gordon Doherty and Matthew J. Kirby. Set within the fictional universe of the video game franchise, it includes collections such as novels, comic books, and encyclopedias. British publishing house Penguin Books was responsible for most of the publications until 2020.[174][175]\\n\\nAudio drama\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Gold is an Audible audio drama by Anthony del Col, released on February 27, 2020. The four-hour drama follows a card shark and hustler called Ailyah Khan (Tamara Lawrence), who is enlisted by Gavin Banks (John Chancer) to relive the memories of 17th century Assassin Omar Khaled (Riz Ahmed). The production also features the voices of Anthony Head, as Isaac Newton, and Danny Wallace, who reprises his series role as Shaun Hastings.[176]\\n\\nBoard games\\nA board game, Assassin\\'s Creed: Arena, was launched on February 26, 2014.[177] Inspired by Assassin\\'s Creed: Revelations, it features many characters from the game, including Shahkulu, Anacletos, Odai Dunqas and Oksana Razin, as well as original characters.[178]\\nOn September 17, 2018, Triton Noir announced a new board game called Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood of Venice.[179] Set in 1509, between the events of Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood and Revelations, it includes characters from the video games like Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Leonardo da Vinci, and Lucrezia Borgia, as well as new characters like Alessandra d\\'Avanzago.[180] It was developed by Thibaud de la Touanne,[181] and was estimated to provide more than 20 hours of play.[182] The game was set to release in November 2018,[183] but was delayed and eventually released in August 2021.[184] In March 2023, an expansion, titled Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood of Venice – Apocalypse and set in the jungles of the Khmer Empire (modern-day Cambodia) during the 16th century, was announced.[185]\\n\\nConcert\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Symphony is a tour across North America and Europe featuring composers who worked on the soundtracks of each game in the series, including Jesper Kyd, Lorne Balfe, Brian Tyler, Austin Wintory, Sarah Schachner, Winifred Phillips, Elitsa Alexandrova, Chris Tilton, Ryan Amon, and The Flight.[186] It was scheduled to begin in the summer of 2019,[187] and expected to feature holographic characters from the series.[188] The 2019–2020 tour was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[189][190][191]\\nThe concert Assassin\\'s Creed Symphonic Adventure, developed by Overlook Events, was presented in a world premiere in Paris on October 29, 2022, at the Le Grand Rex. The world premiere celebrated the 15th anniversary of the video game series. An international world tour is scheduled to begin in 2023. The concert is a two-hour performance with a full symphonic orchestra, also featuring a choir and soloists.[192]\\n\\nReception\\n\\nAggregate review scores\\n\\n\\nGame\\n\\nMetacritic\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed \\n\\n(PC) 79[193](PS3) 81[194](X360) 81[195]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Altaïr\\'s Chronicles \\n\\n(NDS) 58[196]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Bloodlines \\n\\n(PSP) 63[197]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II \\n\\n(PC) 86[198](PS3) 91[199](X360) 90[200]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed II: Discovery \\n\\n(NDS) 69[201]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood \\n\\n(PC) 88[202](PS3) 90[203](X360) 89[204]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rearmed \\n\\n(iOS) 60[205]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Revelations \\n\\n(PC) 80[206](PS3) 80[207](X360) 80[208]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Recollection \\n\\n(iOS) 75[209]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III \\n\\n(PC) 80[210](PS3) 85[211](WIIU) 85[212](X360) 84[213]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed III: Liberation \\n\\n(PC) 66[214](PS3) 64[215](Vita) 70[216](X360) 62[217]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag \\n\\n(PC) 84[218](PS3) 88[219](PS4) 83[220](WIIU) 86[221](X360) 86[222]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed: Pirates \\n\\n(iOS) 67[223]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Memories \\n\\n(iOS) 48[224]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Rogue \\n\\n(PC) 74[225](PS3) 72[226](X360) 72[227]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Identity \\n\\n(iOS) 69[228]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Unity \\n\\n(PC) 70[229](PS4) 70[230](XONE) 72[231]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Syndicate \\n\\n(PC) 74[232](PS4) 76[233](XONE) 78[234]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Chronicles \\n\\n(Vita) 70[235]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Origins \\n\\n(PC) 84[236](PS4) 81[237](XONE) 85[238]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Odyssey \\n\\n(PC) 86[239](PS4) 83[240](XONE) 87[241]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Valhalla \\n\\n(PC) 85[242](PS4) 81[243](XONE) 82[244](XSX) 85[245]\\n\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Mirage \\n\\n(PC) 77/100[246](PS5) 77/100[247](XSXS) 78/100[248]\\n\\nThe Assassin\\'s Creed series has received mainly positive reviews from critics, with Blast Magazine calling it \"the standout series on [the seventh generation] of consoles\".[249] It has been praised for its ambitious game design, visuals, and narratives but criticized for its technical issues and annual releases of almost every installment;[250][251][252] the series\\' shift, which started in Origins,[253] towards prioritising role-playing mechanics over stealth in several games has been considered polarizing.[254][255][256]\\nAs of September\\xa02019[update], the series had sold over 140 million copies with over 95\\xa0million players, becoming Ubisoft\\'s best selling franchise and one of the highest selling video game franchises of all time.[257][258][259] By September 2022, total sales of the series had reached 200 million.[260] The franchise reportedly generated around €4 billion in the decade leading up to 2024.[261]\\n\\nCultural impact\\nElements of Assassin\\'s Creed have been introduced as content into other Ubisoft games and those from third parties. The macOS and Microsoft Windows versions of Team Fortress 2 (2007) features two cosmetic items for the Spy class that were added to promote Assassin\\'s Creed: Revelations; the first is the series\\' signature Hidden Blade, while the second is a hood based on the one Ezio wears in the game.[262] Sackboy, the player character from LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet 2, can be equipped with a skin resembling Ezio\\'s outfit.[263] In Prince of Persia (2008), Altaïr\\'s costume can be unlocked with a code obtained by pre-ordering the game.[264] In 2010\\'s Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, there is an outfit resembling Ezio\\'s robes in Assassin\\'s Creed II, which is unlockable through Uplay.[265] Final Fantasy XIII-2 (2011) includes a costume based on Ezio\\'s outfit from Assassin\\'s Creed: Revelations as an optional costume option as downloadable content.[266]\\nIn Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (2008), Altaïr\\'s outfit is an unlockable cosmetic option for Solid Snake; it was originally announced as an April Fools joke by game director Hideo Kojima.[267] Kojima later returned the favor by allowing Ubisoft to include a Raiden outfit in Assassin\\'s Creed: Brotherhood.[268] In Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker (2010), the player can jump into a bale of hay from a rooftop, which includes the Eagle sound effect used in the Assassin\\'s Creed games, and use it to attract and subdue enemies. The Assassin Order is referenced by a character.[269] In the 2009 Wii game Academy of Champions: Soccer, Altaïr appears as a playable character along with other Ubisoft characters.[270] In the 2012 game Soulcalibur V, Ezio appears as a playable fighter and is featured on the box art.[271] In July 2022, both Ezio and Eivor were added as playable fighters in Brawlhalla (2017).[272]\\nAssassin\\'s Creed IV: Black Flag (2013) introduces the character of Olivier Garneau, the CEO of video game company Abstergo Entertainment, who helps Ubisoft to develop the Assassin\\'s Creed video games within the franchise\\'s fictional universe. During the events of the game, Garneau goes to Chicago, the setting of Ubisoft\\'s 2014 video game Watch Dogs. In the latter game, Garneau is the subject of a side mission that sees the playable protagonist Aiden Pearce saving him from being kidnapped; it is implied this was done by the Assassin Brotherhood. Additionally, two characters in the game are seen playing Assassin\\'s Creed II. Ubisoft has described those appearances as small Easter eggs, and has neither confirmed nor denied a shared continuity between both franchises.[273] Assassin\\'s Creed Origins (2017) mentions the news about Garneau\\'s incident in Chicago, along with a picture of Aiden Pearce killing Garneau.[274]\\nIn downloadable contents (DLC), Ubisoft collaborated with Square Enix to hold a limited-time Assassin\\'s Creed-themed festival event crossover in Final Fantasy XV (2016) on consoles under the title Assassin\\'s Festival, which lasted from August 31, 2017, to January 31, 2018. The DLC featured gameplay elements from the Assassin\\'s Creed game series, new additional quests, mini-games, and exclusive Assassin\\'s Creed-themed items.[275] In January 2020, Nintendo released a Mii Fighter costume based on Altaïr as downloadable content in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018).[276]\\nIn August 2021, Ubisoft released a free update for their 2020 game Watch Dogs: Legion that featured a non-canonical crossover with the Assassin\\'s Creed series. The update introduced optional story content, which sees DedSec crossing paths with and subsequently helping Darcy Clarkson, a member of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood and a descendant of Jacob and Evie Frye. Darcy is also included as a playable character and features a unique Assassin-themed playstyle.[277]\\nThe opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics featured a masked torchbearer wearing a hooded outfit and performing parkour across Paris\\' rooftops. This drew many comparisons to the main characters of the Assassin\\'s Creed series, especially Arno Dorian, the protagonist of Assassin\\'s Creed Unity (2014), which is also set in Paris.[278]\\n\\n\\nSee also\\nList of best-selling video game franchises\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ a b Batchelor, James (September 13, 2022). \"Infinity and beyond: The future of Assassin\\'s Creed\".
